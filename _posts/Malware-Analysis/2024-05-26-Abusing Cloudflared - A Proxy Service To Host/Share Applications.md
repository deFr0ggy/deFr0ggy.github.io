I recently came across `Cloufdflared` project. I have wrote previously on `Visual Studio Code DevTunnels` and how they can be misused to host phishing sites directly from your local machine over the internet. 

However, this looks to be another binary via which we can achieve the same. The major problem which i see is that you can create tunnels unauthenticated, thus giving it into the hands of the user on how they actually want to use this functionality. 

I simply downloaded the tool onto my `Windows Operating System`.

Then simply run the below command to create the tunnels.

Once we have this up and running we can simply, use the URL generated for us and we can access it over the internet.

There are tons of decent usecases for using this functioanlity, however without proper training and controls around this, this is going to create a a mess. 

Adversaries will start using this to have a secure way into getting into the environements. Though, it is dependent on the usecases and how the security controls are implemented. 

I have been able to run a `Phishing Campaign` hosted directly on my local machine over the internet and getting back all the results on my machine.

We can clearly see that by simply hosting a PHP site locally we can have it exposed over the internet and we can connect to it securely. 

Similarly, adversaries will be able to host their payloads and have them accessed through victims machines and a way to deliver their payloads. 

As this is official domain from CloudFlare this will not be blocked straight away, additional controls are monitoring is required to ensure these domains are properly monitored as its fairly easy for the developers to have this tool installed and have data exfiltrated directly over the internet when there are strict controls around.
